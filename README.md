# CS506-Final-Project
Stock Price Prediction Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an advanced machine learning model to predict stock price movements based on historical stock prices, trading volume, and external financial indicators. The project aims to outperform traditional "buy-and-hold" strategies by leveraging deep learning, time-series analysis, and sentiment analysis from financial news.
Project Goals
Successfully predict next-day stock price movement.
Compare different modeling approaches (LSTM, Transformer, XGBoost, Garch and hybrid models).
Develop an interactive visualization K line to display stock trends.
Provide a reproducible pipeline that allows researchers to analyze financial data efficiently.
Data Collection
We will collect data from the following sources:
Stock Price Data
Source: Yahoo Finance API
Collection Method: API calls to retrieve daily historical stock prices, adjusted close prices, and volume data.


Trading Volume & Market Indicators
Source: Alpha Vantage and Quandl
Collected Data: VIX (Volatility Index), S&P 500 index movements, bond yields.
Collection Method: Scheduled API requests with caching to avoid rate limits.


Sentiment Analysis Data
Sources: Bloomberg, Reuters (web scraping), Twitter API
Collected Data: Financial news headlines and social media sentiment related to selected stocks.
Collection Method:
Web scraping with BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for financial news.
Twitter API for real-time sentiment analysis (if API access is granted).
Preprocessing Considerations: Handling API rate limits and removing duplicate news articles.

Data Cleaning
Handling missing values by forward filling or interpolation.
Normalizing numerical data to improve model performance.
Removing outliers that may skew results.
Feature Extraction
Technical Indicators: Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands.
Sentiment Features: Sentiment scores extracted using NLP methods (BERT, VADER, or ChatGPT sentiment analysis API).
Time-based Features: Weekday, holiday effects, quarterly earnings release impact.
Data Visualization
We will create multiple visualizations to explore stock trends and model insights:
Interactive K-line (candlestick) charts to track stock price movements.
Correlation heatmaps to analyze feature relationships.
Dual-axis line charts to compare sentiment analysis trends with stock price changes.
Model performance plots comparing accuracy (MSE, RÂ², Sharpe Ratio) across different models.
Interactive dashboards (Plotly, Dash) allowing users to dynamically select stocks and timeframes.

Model Training
The following models will be implemented and compared:
Baseline Model: Simple Moving Average for prediction.
Traditional Machine Learning: XGBoost, Random Forest.
Deep Learning:
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks): Capturing sequential dependencies.
Transformer-based Models: Forecasting trends using an attention mechanism.
Hybrid Models: Combining CNN and LSTM for feature extraction and sequential pattern learning.
Test Plan
Data Splitting: 80% training, 20% test set.
Cross-validation: Rolling window validation to assess performance stability.
Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Sharpe Ratio for financial performance.
