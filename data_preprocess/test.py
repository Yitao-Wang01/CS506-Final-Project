This could act as a major support level.\n   - ATR ($5,714.92) highlights substantial daily volatility, suggesting wide stop-loss and take-profit levels.\n\n3. **Weekly (1W)**:\n   - Price remains below EMA-9 ($89,500 approx.) and SMA-14, confirming a long-standing bearish trend.\n   - RSI (36-38 range) indicates bearish momentum but is not yet oversold.\n   - Weekly Bollinger Bands indicate very high volatility, with the price moving toward the lower band ($81,000-$82,000 range), which may act as critical support.\n   - MACD histogram is negative, reinforcing the bearish bias over the long term.\n\n### **Support, Resistance & Volatility (Long-Term)**:\n- **Support Levels**:\n  1. **$81,000 - $81,500 (High Importance)**: Lower Bollinger Band on daily/weekly and a psychological round number.\n  2. **$84,665 - $84,750 (Medium Importance)**: Recent 24-hour low and the price of an active limit buy order. This could act as a short-term support.\n- **Resistance Levels**:\n  1. **$89,000 - $89,500 (High Importance)**: SMA-14/EMA-9 on both daily and 4-hour timeframes, marking a strong resistance zone.\n  2. **$91,000 - $91,200 (Medium Importance)**: Take-profit level for an open order and previous swing high.\n  3. **$93,000 (Medium Importance)**: Limit sell order and recent resistance.\n\n- **Volatility**:\n  - Daily ATR ($5,714.92) and 4-hour ATR ($2,461.26) suggest very high volatility, which necessitates smaller position sizes and wider stop-loss/take-profit levels.\n\n---\n\n### **Account Status & Liquidity**:\n- **Liquidity Ratio**: With only $35.97 USD available and approximately -2.997 BTC owed (negative holdings), the account is under extreme liquidity risk (<20% liquidity). Additional funds or risk reduction is urgently needed.\n- Unrealized PnL is at -2.32%, reflecting slight losses relative to the weighted average buy price ($88,001.66).\n- Current positions carry a sell-side bias, with more sell orders than buy orders. The account is overexposed to a bearish trend.\n\n---\n\n### **Order Recommendations**:\n\n#### Open Orders:\n1. **Stop-Loss Sell (Order ID: OCDH3P-GUV34-EQGHP5)**:\n   - **Price**: $81,000\n   - **Volume**: 0.002 BTC\n   - **Action**: Hold.\n   - **Reasoning**: The stop-loss is well-placed near the critical long-term support level ($81,000). Adjusting it lower could expose the account to unnecessary risk.\n\n2. **Take-Profit Sell (Order ID: ODNBJ6-TV5AK-NRJT2R)**:\n   - **Price**: $91,000\n   - **Volume**: 0.002 BTC\n   - **Action**: Hold.\n   - **Reasoning**: This aligns with medium-term resistance, offering a reasonable target for profit-taking in the event of a bullish retracement.\n\n3. **Limit Buy (Order ID: OEAISY-NCYXQ-UPWWAW)**:\n   - **Price**: $84,750\n   - **Volume**: 0.002 BTC\n   - **Action**: Cancel.\n   - **Reasoning**: Current available USD ($35.97) is insufficient to fund this order. Cancel to avoid margin/liquidity risks.\n\n4. **Limit Sell (Order ID: O6ZZ36-XTQQF-ZD2ABR)**:\n   - **Price**: $93,000\n   - **Volume**: 0.002 BTC\n   - **Action**: Hold.\n   - **Reasoning**: This aligns with a medium-term resistance level and could capitalize on a strong upward move.\n\n---\n\n#### New Orders:\n1. **Scaled DCA Buy Order**:\n   - **Price**: $81,500\n   - **Volume**: 0.0005 BTC\n   - **Action**: Create.\n   - **Reasoning**: Buying near the critical support level aligns with long-term positioning. Small volume mitigates liquidity risk.\n   - **Stop-Loss**: $80,000 (3× ATR below entry).\n   - **Take-Profit**: $87,500 (5× ATR above entry).\n   - **Risk Assessment**: Medium.\n   - **Expected Volatility**: High.\n\n---\n\n### **JSON Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"key_levels\": {\n    \"support\": [\n      {\n        \"range\": \"$81,000 - $81,500\",\n        \"timeframe\": \"daily/weekly\",\n        \"importance\": \"high\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Lower Bollinger Band and psychological level.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"range\": \"$84,665 - $84,750\",\n        \"timeframe\": \"daily\",\n        \"importance\": \"medium\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Recent 24-hour low and active buy order level.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"resistance\": [\n      {\n        \"range\": \"$89,000 - $89,500\",\n        \"timeframe\": \"4-hour/daily\",\n        \"importance\": \"high\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"EMA-9/SMA-14 resistance.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"range\": \"$91,000 - $91,200\",\n        \"timeframe\": \"daily\",\n        \"importance\": \"medium\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Take-profit level and swing high.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"range\": \"$93,000\",\n        \"timeframe\": \"daily\",\n        \"importance\": \"medium\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Limit sell order and medium-term resistance.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"recommendations\": {\n    \"orders\": [\n      {\n        \"order_id\": \"OCDH3P-GUV34-EQGHP5\",\n        \"pair\": \"XBTUSD\",\n        \"type\": \"sell\",\n        \"price\": \"81000.0\",\n        \"volume\": \"0.00200000\",\n        \"action\": \"hold\",\n        \"status\": \"pending\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Aligned with critical support level.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"order_id\": \"ODNBJ6-TV5AK-NRJT2R\",\n        \"pair\": \"XBTUSD\",\n        \"type\": \"sell\",\n        \"price\": \"91000.0\",\n        \"volume\": \"0.00200000\",\n        \"action\": \"hold\",\n        \"status\": \"pending\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Aligned with medium-term resistance level.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"order_id\": \"OEAISY-NCYXQ-UPWWAW\",\n        \"pair\": \"XBTUSD\",\n        \"type\": \"buy\",\n        \"price\": \"84750.0\",\n        \"volume\": \"0.00200000\",\n        \"action\": \"cancel\",\n        \"status\": \"open\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Insufficient funds for execution.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"order_id\": \"O6ZZ36-XTQQF-ZD2ABR\",\n        \"pair\": \"XBTUSD\",\n        \"type\": \"sell\",\n        \"price\": \"93000.0\",\n        \"volume\": \"0.00200000\",\n        \"action\": \"hold\",\n        \"status\": \"open\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Aligned with medium-term resistance level.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"new_orders\": [\n      {\n        \"pair\": \"XBTUSD\",\n        \"type\": \"buy\",\n        \"price\": \"81500.0\",\n        \"volume\": \"0.0005\",\n        \"action\": \"create\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Positioning near critical support level.\",\n        \"condition\": \"Breakdown to $81,500.\",\n        \"mode\": \"Post Only\",\n        \"stop_loss\": \"$80,000\",\n        \"take_profit\": \"$87,500\",\n        \"risk_assessment\": \"medium\",\n        \"expected_volatility\": \"high\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"analysis_summary\": \"BTC is in a medium-term bearish trend with weakening momentum.
